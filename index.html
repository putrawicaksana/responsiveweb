     <p>Sir,I'm bit nerveous about being here today<br>
		Still not be sure what going to say<br>
		So,bare with me please<br>
		If i take too much of your time<br><br>
		
		She's my everything and all that I know is<br>
		It would be such a relief if I knew that we were on the same side<br>
		Cause very soon I'm hoping that I...<br><br>
		
		Can marry your daughter<br>
		And make her my wife<br>
		I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life<br>
		And give her the best of me 'til the day that I die, yeah<br>
		I'm gonna marry your princess<br>
		And make her my queen<br>
		She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen<br>
		Can't wait to smile<br>
		When she walks down the aisle<br>
		On the arm of her father<br>
		On the day that I marry your daughter<br><br>
		
		She's been here every steps<br>
		Since the day that we met (I'm scared to death to think of what would happen if she ever left)<br>
		So don't you ever worry about me ever treating her bad<br>
		I've got most of my vows done so far (so bring on the better or worse)<br>
		And 'til death do us part<br>
		There's no doubt in my mind<br>
		It's time<br>
		I'm ready to start<br>
		I swear to you with all of my heart...<br><br>

		I'm gonna marry your daughter<br>
		And make her my wife<br>
		I want her to be the only girl that I'll love for the rest of my life<br>
		And give her the best of me 'til the day that I die, yeah<br>
		I'm gonna marry your princess<br>
		And make her my queen<br>
		She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen<br>
		I can't wait to smile<br>
		As she walks down the aisle<br>
		On the arm of her father<br>
		On the day that I marry your daughter<br><br>

		The first time I saw her<br>
		I swear I knew that I'd say "I do"<br>
		I'm gonna marry your daughter<br>
		And make her my wife<br>
		I want her to be the only girl that I'll love for the rest of my life<br>
		And give her the best of me 'til the day that I die<br>
		I'm gonna marry your princess<br>
		And make her my queen<br>
		She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen<br>
		I can't wait to smile<br>
		As she walks down the aisle<br>
		On the arm of her father<br>
		On the day that I marry your daughter<br><br></p>
